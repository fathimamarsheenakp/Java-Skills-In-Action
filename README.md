# Java-Skills-In-Action

Welcome to the *Java-Skills-In-Action* repository! This project is a reflection of my ongoing journey to learn and master Java programming. As I progress through different concepts and real-world applications, I will continue to add programs, projects, and code snippets to showcase my growing Java skills.

## Overview

This repository contains:

- *Basic Java Programs*: Simple programs covering foundational Java concepts like loops, conditionals, data types, and functions.
- *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*: Programs demonstrating key OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- *Data Structures and Algorithms*: Implementations of essential data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, along with algorithms like sorting and searching.
- *Java 8+ Features*: Exploration of modern Java features like lambda expressions, streams, and functional programming.
- *Projects*: Real-world applications and mini-projects designed to implement and reinforce Java concepts.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, track progress, and create practical examples of the concepts I've learned in Java. Whether you're starting with Java or looking to explore solutions to common problems, you'll find valuable resources and code here.

## Learning Journey

As I continue my exploration of Java, I am focusing on:

- *Core Java fundamentals*: Data types, variables, loops, arrays, and methods.
- *Object-Oriented Programming*: Mastering classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- *Advanced Java*: Deep dive into collections, multi-threading, file handling, exception handling, and more.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or learn alongside me!
